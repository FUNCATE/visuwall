 *
 *        TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION
 *
 *        1. Definitions.
 *
 *           "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,
 *           and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.
 *
 *           "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
 *           the copyright owner that is granting the License.
 *
 *           "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
 *           other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
 *           control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
 *           "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
 *           direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
 *           otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
 *           outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.
 *
 *           "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
 *           exercising permissions granted by this License.
 *
 *           "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
 *           including but not limited to software source code, documentation
 *           source, and configuration files.
 *
 *           "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
 *           transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
 *           not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
 *           and conversions to other media types.
 *
 *           "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
 *           Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
 *           copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
 *           (an example is provided in the Appendix below).
 *
 *           "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
 *           form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
 *           editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
 *           represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
 *           of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
 *           separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
 *           the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
 *
 *           "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
 *           the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
 *           to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
 *           submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
 *           or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
 *           the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
 *           means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
 *           to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
 *           communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
 *           and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
 *           Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
 *           excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
 *           designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."
 *
 *           "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
 *           on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
 *           subsequently incorporated within the Work.
 *
 *        2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
 *           this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
 *           worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
 *           copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
 *           publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
 *           Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
 *
 *        3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
 *           this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
 *           worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
 *           (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
 *           use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
 *           where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
 *           by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
 *           Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
 *           with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
 *           institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
 *           cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
 *           or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
 *           or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
 *           granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
 *           as of the date such litigation is filed.
 *
 *        4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
 *           Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
 *           modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
 *           meet the following conditions:
 *
 *           (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
 *               Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
 *
 *           (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
 *               stating that You changed the files; and
 *
 *           (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
 *               that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
 *               attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
 *               excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
 *               the Derivative Works; and
 *
 *           (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
 *               distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
 *               include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
 *               within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
 *               pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
 *               of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
 *               as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
 *               documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
 *               within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
 *               wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
 *               of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
 *               do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
 *               notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
 *               or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
 *               that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
 *               as modifying the License.
 *
 *           You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
 *           may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
 *           for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
 *           for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
 *           reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
 *           the conditions stated in this License.
 *
 *        5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
 *           any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
 *           by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
 *           this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
 *           Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
 *           the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
 *           with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
 *
 *        6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
 *           names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
 *           except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
 *           origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
 *
 *        7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
 *           agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
 *           Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
 *           WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
 *           implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
 *           of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
 *           PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
 *           appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
 *           risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
 *
 *        8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
 *           whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
 *           unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
 *           negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
 *           liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
 *           incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
 *           result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
 *           Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
 *           work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
 *           other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
 *           has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
 *
 *        9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
 *           the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
 *           and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
 *           or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
 *           License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
 *           on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
 *           of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
 *           defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
 *           incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
 *           of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
 *
 *        END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
 *
 *        APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.
 *
 *           To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following
 *           boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets "[]"
 *           replaced with your own identifying information. (Don't include
 *           the brackets!) The text should be enclosed in the appropriate
 *           comment syntax for the file format. We also recommend that a
 *           file or class name and description of purpose be included on the
 *           same "printed page" as the copyright notice for easier
 *           identification within third-party archives.
